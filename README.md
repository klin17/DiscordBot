# DiscordBot

## Description
This bot is made for fun and not to do anything too serious. It has various simple commands mostly created to test out the Discord.js API. It also can respond to certain key phrases with hardcoded responses. 

### Bot Add Link
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=821816503791124523&scope=bot&permissions=2147483647  
_You can only add bots to servers you have MANAGE_GUILD permissions for_

## Bot Editing
Please make sure to run `npm install` to install the required packages before testing. Let me know if you need to test your code so I can turn off the cloud bot.
