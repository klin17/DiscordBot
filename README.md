## Bot Editing
Please make sure to run `npm install` to install the required packages before testing. Let me know if you need to test your code so I can turn off the cloud bot.


**Ideas and things to maybe add:**
 - [x] logging in as bot admin
 - [x] polling
 - [ ] ~~batch commands~~ (conflicts with $echo msgWithComma)
 - [ ] $ban and $unban
 - [ ] $kick
 - [ ] add Time parameter for revoke
 - [x] DM permadmins when $login succcessful
 - [ ] Extend reaction functionality
 - [x] Add embed for $help
 - [ ] $keywords, to list keywords
 - [ ] Reaction from command caller dismisses bot response message
 - [ ] Be able to disable commands/keywords
 - [x] Move commands into separate files
 - [ ] Prevent word banning in DMs to bot
 - [ ] Prevent commands in DMs?
 - [ ] Use nickname and add guild info to $login notification
